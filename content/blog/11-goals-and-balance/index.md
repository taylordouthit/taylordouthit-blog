Several years ago, I started doing something that has yielded some big gains in productivity, confidence, and general well-being that I thought I'd take some time to share.

## Setting Goals

Each year, I jot down some goals, splitting them into seven categories: mental health, physical health, career, relationships, finances, adventure, and lifestyle. I keep it simple, using colored pencils and markers on a sheet of plain paper, which I stick on the fridge where I can easily see it.

#### Some examples of goals I've set for myself have been:

- Do 10 pull-ups consecutively
- Raise 401k contribution to 15%
- Visit Smoky Mountains National Park
- Record 100 journal entries
- Read 30 books
- Try a new programming language

#### Setting goals has taught me how to set effective goals. Some bad goals I've set for myself have been:

- Be more grateful
- Learn a new technology
- Practice no phones before bed

There's a glaring issue with these that might not be apparent if you haven't set goals for yourself before. That is: when do you check these off as being accomplished? How do I determine when I've practiced enough gratefulness to check it off? The simple answer is you can't.

#### SMART Goals

Over the years, I've learned that clarity and specificity are key. For instance, a good goal might be "Meditate for 10 minutes every day to improve mental well-being." It's clear, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). On the other hand, an example of a not-so-good goal would be "Be more relaxed." While the intention is positive, it lacks specificity and a clear action plan.

Financial goals often lend themselves naturally to being SMART. For instance, a good financial goal could be "Save $5,000 by the end of the year for a down payment on a house." It's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. However, a vague financial goal like "Be better with money" lacks the necessary specificity and timeline to make it effective.

It's worth mentioning that sometimes goals may be achieved with a slight delay. For instance, some of the goals I set for 2021 might be accomplished in 2022, and that's perfectly fine. It's important to stay flexible and adapt as we progress on our journeys. Goals serve as guideposts and provide a roadmap for our personal growth and development. What's even more important is the **systems** we put in place to get us there.

## Systems

What kind of systems, you ask? I'm all about productivity and getting rid of distractions. My systems revolve around managing my time effectively and cutting out the stuff that doesn't add any value.

Before the pandemic, I decided to cut back on social media. Well, most of it, at least. Sure, I sometimes feel a bit out of the loop with my friends, but the freedom and positivity of not being tied to social profiles and the need to constantly present a certain image to the world have been truly liberating. I ditched Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and a bunch of others. The time I got back from this has been monumental in doing the things I want to do in life.

#### If you're looking to reduce your social media time and boost productivity, let me suggest a couple of books for you:

"Atomic Habits" by James Clear.

"Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport.

These books have had a significant impact on me, shaping the way I think and how I view our relationship with technology and social media. To sum it up, establish systems and habits that help you reach your goals. Cut down on digital distractions and take a close look at each platform you're on. Ask yourself if it truly adds value to your life.

## It's All About Consistency

Here's a system that's been working well for me lately: I set my iPhone to "do not disturb" mode every morning and evening, allowing me to have uninterrupted sleep and peaceful mornings. I also disable most of my apps at specific times to stay focused. And every morning, I make it a habit to get up and write. It's not about creating a masterpiece; it's about the consistency of the practice. I genuinely believe that if I stick with these habits, they'll lead to significant gains.

#### "Just stick with it."

What a phrase. In my opinion, there's no better advice than simply sticking with something for a while. We all start as beginners, and let's be honest, being bad at something isn't exactly enjoyable (although it can be with the right mindset).

The true value of perseverance becomes evident when we start seeing the results of our efforts after a considerable amount of time. For me, it was cycling consistently in 2016. One day, I looked at my legs and realized they had gained noticeable muscle definition—a first for me. It might sound silly, but it made me realize that putting in a little work each week adds up, even if the progress isn't immediately apparent. It takes about a year or so to truly appreciate the gains.

## Find Balance, Get Physical

I'm grateful that I learned this lesson at the young age of 26, and I'm even more grateful that it came through physical activity. In today's world, where we're constantly tied to desks, computers, or laptops—hunched over, constantly working—I've learned how crucial it is to balance desk time with physical goals.

Physical exercise has become a powerful remedy for mild depression and anxiety. There's something transformative that happens when we move our bodies, something that shifts our entire outlook on life. Maybe it's the release of dopamine, scientifically speaking, but whatever it is, it's truly remarkable.
