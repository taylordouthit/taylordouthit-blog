## My Start in Writing Code

It was in the spring of my junior year of college that I got my first taste of programming. I was studying psychology at a four-year liberal arts university with electives to spare when I stumbled upon _Intro to Computer Science 1_. The class was taught using the Python programming language. I was not familiar with Python, but I heard coding was becoming an increasingly in-demand skill, so I enrolled.

It was not a smooth ride. I did terribly, so terribly in fact that I withdrew from the class at the midterm. There were so many topics I had never heard of before: strings, booleans, functions, lists, and integrated development environments. I was lost in this strange new land. Overwhelmed. Yet, I felt something I had never felt before from my psychology courses: it was way more challenging and hands-on; it was enthralling.

I decided I was not ready to give up. I knew that if I stuck with it, my future would be bright, but I had to do things differently if I wanted to succeed.

### A Second Go

I retook the class the following semester and got an _A-_. I was very proud of that accomplishment. But what changed? How was I able to become so much more proficient in writing code in Python?

The truth is, it took a whole summer of working through Zed Shaw's _Learn Python the Hard Way_. I read each page in depth and retyped each example into IDLE (Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment). It was a bit tedious at times, but I was determined to learn. I was determined to become a software developer.

I knew this wasn't enough, however. Python alone could not land me a job writing code professionally. I knew that if I wanted to write code professionally, there were a dozen other things I needed to learn about. I had no time to switch majors though, that would delay my graduation and add to an already hefty student loan bill. I accepted that I would have to learn these things on my own, just like I did that summer with Python.

### Supplemental Learning

With the remainder of my senior year, I fit in a couple more programming courses albeit nowhere near the number required to graduate with a Computer Science degree. I took an intro to databases, another Python course, an introduction to web development, and a discrete math course. In my free time, I was reading books about web development, which in my opinion, is where most people without CS degrees have the best shot of entering the larger field of software development. Becoming a front-end developer, specifically, is what I was targeting.

Some skills I had and recommend others to learn for frontend are:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- A library like Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Git
- Command Line

## Finding my First Job

I began the way most do, building out a portfolio at my own domain taylordouthit.com and placing all the code on GitHub so employers could have a look at the quality of my code. I tried my best to write clean JavaScript (at the time I was using a lot of jQuery), CSS, and HTML. I picked up a few more books, worked on projects to add to my portfolio, and entered myself into every local programming scene including meetups and online communities.

With all that I did, I was still having trouble getting my foot in the door. I can even remember being discouraged after talking with an engineer at a local meetup about what he was working on. He listed off the various problems he was solving and what technologies he was using, but I only understood at most 10% of what he was saying. Was I not learning the right things? Was I not working hard enough? I was beginning to think I was not cut out for this.

The application process was daunting as well. Dozens of different platforms to apply on, cover letters, coding challenges, it all felt overwhelming. It felt like I was back in that intro to computer science class and lost all over again. That is until I decided, again, that I would carve my own path. I would not let the process discourage me.

What I decided to do was to go on the `About Us` section of local start-ups and cold email developers. I hoped someone would like me or my work enough to pass my resume off to a hiring manager. I also used that opportunity to ask about the company culture, what they liked about working as a developer, what they didn't like, etc. And it worked! I got an interview with a small education technology start-up.

## The Interview

Nothing can quite prepare you for being interviewed by a team of eight simultaneously. That was what happened to me in my first interview. I sat nervously at the end of a conference room table and had to introduce myself to a bunch of strangers and make my case for why they should hire me. I sweat bullets the entire time.

What I tried my best to do at that moment was be myself. I talked about where I was from, what I studied, and what I was passionate about. We ended up talking more about video games and hobbies than we did my actual portfolio. The thing you have to keep in mind, especially for entry-level gigs, is that oftentimes the team is looking for someone they can work with and get along with. They want someone who will be a good fit for the team, the company, and the culture. They understand that the technology you know comes second. If you can be a good teammate and learn on the job, then you'll likely succeed.

### Web Dev Internship Landed

The interview went well and I got my first offer to write code professionally for a whopping `$35,000`. I heard the paychecks were supposed to be bigger in the tech industry, but I was still excited. I was going to be a web developer and I was on my way to building valuable skills that would help me become a better web developer.
